            <h3>Chemistry</h3>
            <p class="code-skill-description" > I have been studying and researching as a chemist for almost 10 years, in a wide array of fields such as consumer goods, e-commerce, and renewable energy. Over time, I have had the chance to launch many consumer goods products such as shampoos, lotions, gummies, and much more! I love being able to go to a shelf, point to a product, and say "I made that!"   </p>

            <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
            <p class="chili-skill-description" > I love puzzles, brain teasers, and problem solving. I have a unique ability to break down confusing puzzles into small, easy to tackle solutions that my team can target to achieve our goals. I thrive best in environments where I can solve these puzzles every day. </p>

            <h3>Video Games</h3>
            <p class="chili-skill-description" > I started playing video games as soon as I could hold a controller and never looked back. Video games have allowed me to learn many important life skills such as communication, a healthy competitive spirit, and the drive to never give up until I complete the end game, among more!  </p>
